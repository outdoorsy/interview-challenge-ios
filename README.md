# iOS Code Challenge

Thanks for applying for an iOS developer role at Outdoorsy. We've put together this code challenge. It should take around two hours to complete.

## Functionality
This task is to develop a single-page app that provides the ability to search Outdoorsy listings by keyword. Users will be able to type keywords in a text field. Typing in the text field will search for relevant results and display them for the user. Listings should display an image of the vehicle and the vehicle’s name.

### What the app should look like
See https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-ios/blob/main/Challenge-Design.png

### The API you will need to use
See https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-ios/blob/main/API.md

## Quality requirements
- Build this as if it will be maintained for a while (code organization, maintainability, extensibility).
- Use common, modern Swift architecture.
- Make performant API requests.
- The project should run on phones; iPad support is optional.

## What we’re looking for
- Functionality of project matches description above
- Visual design (mostly, not pixel perfect) matches designs
- Ability to think through all potential states
- Code design/style should be consistent and reasonable
- In the `README.md` of the project, describe exactly how to run the application

## Notes
- Please make frequent and descriptive git commits.
- Use any dependencies that you find useful to complete the task.
- Please use the most modern version of Swift and Xcode.
- Use either SwiftUI, UIKit, or both.

When complete, please push your code to Github and send the link to the project or zip the project (including the `.git` directory) and send it back.

**Thank you and please ask if you have any questions!**

## Extra Credit
- Implement a cool new feature or functionality we didn't ask for!
- Unit tests?
- Add a `README.md` and list what would you do differently if you had a whole week to work on this.
- Add extra code/features with the following characteristics in mind:
  - Performance
  - Aesthetics
  - Usability
